### 🥋 A3C for Kung Fu Karate – Reinforcement Learning Agent

This project implements an *A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)* reinforcement learning algorithm to train an agent for a custom *Kung Fu Karate environment*, enabling it to learn complex martial arts moves, defend itself, and win battles through trial and error.



## 🚀 Project Overview

* 🎯 *Goal:* Train an RL agent using the *A3C algorithm* to play a Kung Fu fighting game environment efficiently.
* 🧠 *Method:* Leverages multiple asynchronous agents that interact with parallel environments to update a shared global network.
* 🎮 *Environment:* Built using \[OpenAI Gym / Unity ML-Agents] (customized for martial arts combat logic).
* 🔁 *Reward Function:* Designed to reward offensive actions, successful dodges, and victories.
